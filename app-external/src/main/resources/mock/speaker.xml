He has 23 years&amp;rsquo; research experience in cardiovascular disease working in laboratories in London, Cambridge and Oxford, Where his interests focused predominantly on atherosclerosis, with studies ranging from pathology, through molecular and cellular biology to molecular genetics. In 1997, he was recruited by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals from a Senior Fellowship Position leading his own molecular genetics group in Oxford, to lead the exploration of new therapeutic approaches in atherosclerosis, specifically focusing on is research interests in vascular biology. Following the merger with Astra, Dr Henney moved within the newly formed company, AstraZeneca, to a position of Global Programme Manager Responsible for prototyping strategic improvements to the company&amp;rsquo;s approaches to pharmaceutical target identification, and the reduction of attrition in early development. This involved directing activities both across research sites and across functional project teams in the US, Sweden and the UK. The work undertaken in this Programme resulted in the creation of an entirely new multidisciplinary department that focused on pathway mapping, modelling and simulation. With personnel based in the UK and US, and global project interactions across all therapy areas, the work of this department supported drug projects across Research and Development. Under his leadership, the department evolved to establish the practice of Systems Biology that, together with strong relationships with key academic centres and biotechs, prototyped the application of mechanistic disease modelling approaches to the discovery and development of innovative medicines. Since leaving AstraZeneca in 2009, Dr Henney has continued his interest in Systems Biology through his company, Obsidian Biomedical Consulting Ltd., helping academics to work more closely with industry. In April 2010, Dr Henney was invited to direct a new German national flagship research programme in Systems Biology: The Virtual Liver Network, which is his current major focus&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;David Stuckler;&lt;/strong&gt; Dr. Stuckler&amp;acute;s research integrates the sciences of public health with political economy and development economics. He is currently focusing on three areas of population health and development. His research in macro-social and -economic determinants of health, political economy of global health and development, and comparative social welfare, empirically evaluates the mortality crisis that occurred after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He is analysing the role of economic processes, and their interactions with culture, firms and the state, using quasi-experimental approaches. Another area of Dr Stuckler&amp;rsquo;s research focuses upon the political economy of global health: understanding the current and changing roles of global institutions, states, NGOs, the private sector, civil society and the interactions among them for control of chronic and infectious diseases. In addition, he is currently working to model and analyse the effects of market forces on patient decision-making, medical errors, and access to and quality of healthcare. Dr Stuckler joined the University of Cambridge, Faculty of Politics, Psychology, Sociology and International Studies in July 2011, from his previous position as Assistant Professor of Political Economy at Harvard University.
